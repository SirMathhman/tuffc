It does not verify that the program produces correct output for any given input, nor that external C code called via FFI is itself safe. It does not constitute a formal mathematical proof; it records the outcome of a structural compiler analysis. A failed compilationOutcome means that one or more safety properties could not be established; the diagnosticCodes field identifies which checks triggered."
